Create a new Code Cell below the code snippets inside Raw Cells (Insert Cell below then convert the cell type to Code Cell).\n","2. Go to your newly-created Code Cell and re-type what you see in the code snippet (don't copy-paste)\n","3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell.\n","4. Remember to learn by doing (not just by reading or seeing)\n","\n","### For Coders\n","1. If you are not yet familiar with the concept, follow Steps 1&2 of the Instructions for Beginners\n","2. If you are already familiar with the concept being presented, convert the Raw Cell into a Code Cell.\n","3. Execute (and experiment) on the Code Cell.\n","4. Learn the \"adjacent concepts\", e.g. read related documentation\n","5. Help your classmates, because teaching is a wonderful way to learn.\n","\n","### For All\n","* Make this your personal notebook.\n","    * Add your own text annotations in Markup Cells.\n","    * Add comments to parts of code that you find difficult to understand\n","    * Breakdown difficult code into several small pieces (maybe, several Code Cells) that are easier to understand"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FdqsuWtge3qw"},"source":["<a id='contents'></a>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VUJp88Kke3qw"},"source":["# TABLE OF CONTENTS"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X1z9vi3re3qw"},"source":["[Terminal Commands and Magic Commands (Optional)](#chapter0)<br>\n","[Chapter 1 Introduction](#chapter1)<br>\n","[Chapter 2 Variables, Expressions, and Statements](#chapter2)<br>\n","[Chapter 3 Conditional Execution](#chapter3)<br>\n","[Chapter 4 Functions](#chapter4)<br>\n","[Chapter 5 Iterations](#chapter5)<br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Mounting Google Colab"],"metadata":{"id":"rCkukg5t-u0q"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iK_3-7pEiw1i","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770618441481,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":33140,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Jamile","userId":"16011810079692222041"}},"outputId":"cdbbdcb5-e50b-4a29-b90d-1607afeb8fef"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pwd"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"C5hC5vqCHU74","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770618623888,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":103,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Jamile","userId":"16011810079692222041"}},"outputId":"3b61c262-b900-4056-b2fa-41c2a85c6a45"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["cd /content/drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/IS110_BPerformance_Jamile"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mBhmcBuWGGUE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770618725813,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Jamile","userId":"16011810079692222041"}},"outputId":"ae223c1c-0704-45ee-cc66-e878741e2aad"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/ColabNotebooks/IS110_BPerformance_Jamile\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ls"],"metadata":{"id":"lJW2QJBQGe8O"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vlq8Y5HXe3qx"},"source":["# Terminal Commands and Magic Commands (Optional)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QlXG9uq6e3qx"},"source":["Below are some useful tools for doing work in Jupyter.
